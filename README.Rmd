## Abstract

The Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) study area is an area west of Antarctica. It is one of the three existing research facilities that the United States has to analyze Antarctic marine ecosystems. One of the organisms investigated by the biologists in this facility is the penguin. Observations of the Chinstrap, Adélie, and Gentoo penguins have been recorded on three islands with various measurements in the size, length, region, sex, stage, etc. The health of penguins is often determined by their size and if they can reproduce efficiently. It is for this reason that I want to determine if there is a significant difference in the size of the penguin species and if they have full clutch sizes. I will use exploratory data analysis to determine this. I plan to compare each species of penguins and the percentage at which they completed their clutch. With this data analysis, I intend to draw conclusions if there is a correlation between species of the penguins and how well they can produce a full clutch size.   

## Introduction

The Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) study area is an area west of Antarctica. It is one of the three existing research facilities that the United States has in order to analyze Antarctic marine ecosystems. These Antarctic marine ecosystems include sea ice habitats, oceanography, and bird nesting sites. One of the bird species that have been examined were the antarctic penguins found on three islands. The three species of penguins that were examined were the Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap penguins which make up over half of the avian life in Antarctica (Ancel, 2013). These penguins all occupy the islands of Antarctica and tend to stay on one island for the entire year where they hunt and breed. Chinstrap and Adelie penguins have similar weights and statures at roughly 10 pounds and 2 feet tall. However, Gentoo penguins are the third largest penguins which weigh 17 pounds and stand at 2 and a half to 3 feet tall. Different statistics of these penguins were taken for determination of age, size, island, sex, reproduction, and isotope concentration. Each of these statistics could be pulled from their website to be analyzed. Of the most interest to most scientists is the result of how well a species can reproduce. The reproduction success rate is measured in many different ways as organisms show different reproduction strategies. Birds employ a strategy of laying eggs then caring for their young until they can leave the nest. These nests are known as clutches and vary in size according to the species of bird and where the bird is located. For the penguins under research, completed clutch has two eggs in them while an uncompleted clutch would have one or no eggs in the clutch. The likelihood of a completed clutch is determined by many variables including climate, food availability, and competition (Enrich, 1988). One such variable includes the size of the body mass of the penguin. Research shows that an organism that weighs more than their counterparts is shown to have a higher probability to survive and reproduce. This is because the reproductive process is metabolically taxing and once it is over these organisms have lost their fat stores. This means that those who have greater fat stores are more likely to have the energy to find food after reproducing. This improves the odds of that organism surviving and reproducing again (Hansen, 2013). It is for this reason the variables that will be explored in this experiment is the species and mass of the penguin. In this experiment, I will compare each of the penguin species to the percentage of completed clutches they have. My hypothesis is that there will be no significant difference between the mass distribution of the penguins and the percentage of incompleted clutch size. This will be analyzed using exploratory data analysis.           

## Methods and Materials

### Data Aquisition

1. Data was taken from the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) study area in Antarctica. These Datasets were downloaded from given packages on github (Horst, et al., 2020).

2. The available datasets packages found on github were uploaded into R studio (RStudio Team, 2020)   

3. Associated packages were downloaded to run these datasets in Rstudio (Wickham, 2020) (Wickham et al., 2021). 

### Data Preparation

1. The Palmar Penguins datasets was converted into a table and run so all the observations and variables were present. The dataset known as "penguins_raw" was then used for the remainder of the experiment. 

2. The table's labels were then renamed so that the dataset could be used to create graphs and charts without hassle.

3. The body masses of each species was compared for each. island. This was done by graphing the body masses of each species compared to the individual islands.

4. The number of penguins for each species was determined by creating a bar graph. 

5. The number of completed clutches and uncompleted clutches were examined for each species. This was done by creating a stacked bar graph.

6. Body masses of each species were individually analyzed by the frequency of their occurrence. 

## Results

The results show that all three penguin species have a distribution that follows a normal curve. If we look at the clutch completion of each species, we see that the Gentoo penguin also has the highest proportion of incomplete clutches compared to the other two penguin species.

## Discussion

The results showed the highest proportion of incomplete clutches of all the penguin species. However, all three of the penguin species showed a normal distribution with no significant differences in the distribution. Therefore, there is no correlation between the mass of a penguin and the completion percentage of a clutch. When research is conducted on the deviations of body masses in a species, we find that the correlation between mass and reproduction is inconclusive. A study done on moles showed that there is a positive correlation to increased body mass and reproductive success for females. However, there is no correlation in body mass and reproductive success for males (Boratyński, 2010). This is because females don't select males on body mass alone. Therefore, it should be expected for organisms that the correlation between body mass and reproductive success is not one dimensional. That means other factors would have a major impact on the reproductive success of organisms. I would expand upon this experiment in one of two ways. I would look at the sex of the penguins and determine if body mass is correlated to the reproductive success of a male or female penguin. I would also expand upon this by taking more experiment subjects of each penguin species on multiple islands and record data on them for 5 years.
