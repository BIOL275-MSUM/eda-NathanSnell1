## Abstract

The Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) study area is an area west of Antarctica. It is one of the three existing research facilities that the United States has to analyze Antarctic marine ecosystems. One of the organisms investigated by the biologists in this facility is the penguin. Observations of the Chinstrap, Ad√©lie, and Gentoo penguins have been recorded on three islands with various measurements in the size, length, region, sex, stage, etc. The health of penguins is often determined by their size and if they can reproduce efficiently. It is for this reason that I want to determine if there is a significant difference in the size of the penguin species and if they have full clutch sizes. I will use exploratory data analysis to determine this. I plan to compare each species of penguins to the clutch completion recorder for each species. I will then determine the proportion of how many pengins had their clutch completed for each species. With this data analysis, I hope draw conclusions to if there is a link between species of the penguins and how well they can produce a full clutch size.   

## Introduction

The Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) study area is an area west of Antarctica. It is one of the three existing research facilities that the United States has in order to analyze Antarctic marine ecosystems. These Antarctic marine ecosystems include sea ice habitats, oceanography, and bird nesting sites. One of the birds that were examined were the antarctic penguins found on three islands. The three species of penguins that were examined were the Adelie, Gentoo, and Chinstrap penguins. Different statistics of these penguins were taken for determination of age, size, island, sex, reproduction, and isotope concentration. Each of these statistics could be pulled from their website to be analyzed.      

## Methods and Materials

1. Data was taken from the Palmer Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) study area in Antarctica.

2. The available dataset was downloaded into R studio

3. Comparisons of body mass of each species was compared for each island.

4. The species and the number of penguins were compared.

5. The number of completed clutches and uncompleted clutches were examined for each species
